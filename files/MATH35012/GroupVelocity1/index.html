<h1>Group velocity 1</h1>

<h1>Adding two waves with slightly different wavenumbers. </h1> 

See section 3.10 in the lecture notes.

We argued that a simple way of examining the influence of dispersion was
to consider the sum of two periodic signals of "nearly equal" frequency and
wavelength (or equivalently wave number). This gave rise to what we
defined to be a wave 'group' which had its own 'group velocity'.
In the animations below we look at the evolution of the sum of two
waves for a few different dispersion relations.

Here is the superposition of two waves where the dispersion relation
has been chosen to match that of infinite depth, linearised, free-surface
gravity waves. In this case c_g = c / 2 (ie, the green point is moving
at twice the speed of the blue one).

This is still a gravity wave as above, but with the introduction of
a new physical effect that we will discuss later in the course. This
extra effect alters the dispersion relation and can change the 
relative size of the phase and group speeds. In this case c_g > c.

<p>
This is the superposition of two waves with a dispersion relation that
is rather different; the dispersion relation is a simple 1-D model of 'Rossby waves'
which are of some significance in atmospheric flows. Note that in this
case the group velocity c_g is negative even though c is positive.
