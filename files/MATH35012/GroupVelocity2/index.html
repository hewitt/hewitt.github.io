<h1>Group velocity 2</h1>

<h1>Evolution of a single group. </h1>

See section 3.10 in the lecture notes.

The simplistic argument of just adding two waves together also
applies to a narrow (continuous) band of wave frequencies. Here,
instead of 2 discrete waves, we look at the evolution of just
such a narrow band for a free surface gravity wave. The animations
are the SAME wave, only the frame of reference changes (and its
always stationary or in uniform translation).

<p>
Here we see a single group evolving with time. The wave is
viewed from a stationary frame of reference. Note that the group
as a whole is moving. The individual wave crests are propagating
more quickly than the group in this case, disappearing at the
'front' and appearing at the 'back'.

<h2>In a frame of reference that moves with the phase speed:</h2>

<p>
Here we see a single group evolving with time. The wave is
viewed from a uniformly translating frame of reference, moving with
the phase speed. Because our reference frame is moving with the 
phase speed, the individual crests/troughs appear stationary. However,
because in this case the group velocity is less than the phase speed
the group propagates to the left.

<p>
Here we see a single group evolving with time. The wave is
viewed from a uniformly translating frame of reference, moving with
the group velocity. Because our reference frame is moving with the 
group, the maximum of the envelope is stationary. However,
because in this case the group velocity is less than the phase speed
the we see the individual crests and troughs propagating to the right.
They disappear at the 'front' and appear at the 'back' of the group.
