<h1> The effects of dispersion. </h1> 

A wave is 'dispersive' if the phase velocity of the wave is dependent
on the wavelength (or equivalently, the wavenumber) of the wave. We've
seen a number of 'non-dispersive' waves so far, and one 'dispersive'
wave (a free surface gravity wave).

In non-dispersive waves the phase speed is a constant. Here we show an initial
condition (a Gaussian hump) evolving in a non-dispersive system. Note the
lack of signal distortion as time evolves as all Fourier components propagate
at the same speed.

<p>
Water waves are only non-dispersive in the LIMIT of shallow water (i.e., as the 
wavelength of the wave tends to infinity, or fluid depth tends to zero). 
In practice, for a given wavelength and fluid depth (such that the ratio of fluid
depth over wavelength is small) the system will only be non-dispersive to leading order.
Any correction terms will, in general, cause dispersion, albeit a 'weak' dispersion.
Here is the same problem, but with a small correction that we may associate with
the problem being 'almost' a shallow water wave problem. Note that there is some
slight signal distortion.

<h2>Free surface gravity waves are dispersive:</h2>

<p>
This case is a (infinite depth) free surface gravity wave,
which we've seen is dispersive in the lecture notes. We've shown that long waves propagate
faster than short waves. You can see this as time evolves -- note that the
initial signal is the same shape as the non-dispersive case above. The
dependence of the phase speed on the wavelength causes the signal to distort 
and the evolution is considerably more complicated.
